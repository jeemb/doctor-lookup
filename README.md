# _Doctor Search Tool_

#### API Integration JavaScript Project 4.17.2017

#### By Jennifer Beem

## Description

This app explores a new concept in my learning: "API integration" with JavaScript. The app utilizes a medical information API to search for doctors who treat user-inputted symptoms. A user is able to input their symptoms into this app and receive information on doctors in the Portland are that could treat them.

### Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * .env file for API key
  * Front page for user input interface
  * Second page for object-oriented methods and constructors
  * Exports to link API key to second page

2. Specifications
|Behavior|Example Input|Example Output|
|User inputs medical symptom|"toothache"|Doctor Name/info|

3. UX/UI
 * Use Sass/Boostrap to style
